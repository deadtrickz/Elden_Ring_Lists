You will have three dialogue options: Option 1: Put it behind you, if you choose this option, you will not see Moore again until much later, and will receive his armor once you defeat him in a boss battle toward the end of the game. Option 2: Remain sad forever, If you choose this option, he will be found dead near the Forager Brood North of the Church of the Crusade. You can then collect his greatshield, armor, and bell bearing. NOTE: WHEN HE DIES FROM THIS OPTION, YOU WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO COLLECT THE REMAINING FORAGER BROOD COOKBOOKS. Option 3: I don't know, choosing this option will keep Moore here longer, but will ultimately lead to the outcome of option 1, and you will still get his gear                                                                                           |

NOTE: There are only a few locations where you can duplicate a remembrance in the DLC. to get every item in two playthroughs, you will need to duplicate the Remembrance of a God and a Lord on one of the playthroughs as there are three items you can receive. Because Messmer and Romina are required to get to the final boss of the DLC each time, it is recommended not to duplicate their remembrance. Metyr (Count Ymir questline) is also required to defeat in two playthroughs, so you shouldn't duplicate their remembrance either. This leaves you with two remembrances you can duplicate on the first playthrough, and three you can duplicate on the second playthrough, making FIVE of the TEN DLC remembrance bosses optional |
